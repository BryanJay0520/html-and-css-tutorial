        [Verse 1]
        Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
        Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
        When she gets that "come get me" look in her eyes
        Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
        When she drives me wild

        [Chorus]
        Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
        The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
        And wears her heart on her sleeve
        Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

        [Verse 2]
        She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
        Till she changes her mind
        Says, "Let's stay on the couch and watch TV"
        And she falls asleep

        [Chorus]
        Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
        The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
        And wears her heart on her sleeve
        Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

        [Bridge]
        She's unpredictable, unforgettable
        It's unusual, unbelievable
        How I'm such a fool, yeah, I'm such a fool for her
